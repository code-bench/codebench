# codebench
Automated code benchmark solution. Empower developers with tools to trace and analyze project performances.

### TODO:
- prettier report (maybe a web page)
- more reported information (disk, memory, etc.)
- samples (put into readme)
- first release
- add CI
- specify commit range (instead of a list)
- use configuration file (with parser maybe)
- should monitor child processes

### DONE:
- specify a list of commits, run benchmark
- report CPU usage information
