# codebench
Automated code benchmark solution. Empower developers with tools to trace and analyze project performances.

### TODO:
- specify a list of commits/range, run benchmark
- more reported information (CPU usage, etc.)
- prettier report (maybe a web page)
- samples (put into readme)
- first release
- add CI
- use configuration file (with parser maybe)
